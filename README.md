# Boston Metro Multigraph

## Summary
The idea of the project is to implement a multigraph abstract data type (ADT). The multigraph is a graph, which is permitted to have multiple edges , that is edges, that have the same end nodes. The multigraph model is then used to model the Boston Metro System in a program that is able to provide directions to passengers on how to get from one station to another.

## To run the executable:
1. Place the bostonmetro.txt file in the same directory as the .jar.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the executable.
3. Run the following command: `java -jar BostonMetroMultiGraph.jar bostonmetro.txt`
